	<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> Hi, I'm Carlton Coakley Jr, a 24-year-old graduate student at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. Originally from Jamaica, I moved to NYC at the age of 12 and hold a bachelors degree in English. I have six years of experience working with children as a preschool teacher, and while my professional journalism experience is growing, I am passionate about multimeida storytelling, including photography, video, and audio. I hope to one day write for Vogue or another magazine, combining my craft in journalism and fashion. I enjoy a laid-back lifestyle filled with movies, socializing, and personal downtime. </p>

<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Piece of Journalism Stories includes;</h2>

<ul>
	<li> 
		<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-border-security-spending-texas-arizona" target="_blank">Trump Spends Billions on Border Security, But Leaves Residents with Lmit Access to Basic Survival Resources</a> - I find immigrations stories like this interesting because they highlight the gap between government priorities and human needs. This story in particular show how funds are poured into security while border communities struggle. It's powerful as it reveas how officals often lack empathy, treating immigrants as statistics instead of human beings.</li>

		<a href="https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/stories/world-press-photo-2025-temiloluwa-johnson"target="_blank">Documenting Nigeria Queer Vogue Ballroom Scene Photo-Journalism</a> - I came across this piece eariler this year and wow, photojournalism is just as important as the written words are. The visuals tell the story of Nigera's underground LGBTQ+ Ballroom scene, which exists in a counrty with strict laws and hostile attitudes towards queer people. Like in my home country Jamaica, being openly queer in Nigeria can be dangerous, yet this piece shows how the community creates safe spaces filled with joy, love, and resilience. I admire how the photographer captures not just survival, but celebration, and how it preserves a legacy of queer resistance and chosen family. </li>

			<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63851215"target="_blank">Week-in-the-life of a maid from Qatar's Rich</a> - Although this article was published a couple of years ago, upon reading it a while back, I found the angel and walkthrough of it intriguing as it highlights hidden labor behind luxury. While Qatar has faced international scrutiny over its treatment of migrant workers, this piece shifts the focus to domestic workers employed by the elite. It shows the dual reality; for some workers, the job provides financial supports and small privileges, but for others, it means exploitation, long hours, and no days off. It uncovers inequality is embedded in global labor systems. </li>
